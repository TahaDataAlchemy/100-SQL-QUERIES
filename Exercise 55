Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.


WITH totalval AS (
    SELECT p.product_id, 
           SUM(CASE WHEN u.units IS NOT NULL THEN p.price * u.units ELSE 0 END) AS total_value,
           SUM(CASE WHEN u.units IS NOT NULL THEN u.units ELSE 0 END) AS total_units
    FROM Prices p
    LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
      ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
     AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
    GROUP BY p.product_id
)

SELECT p.product_id, 
       ROUND(totalval.total_value / CASE WHEN totalval.total_units = 0 THEN 1 ELSE totalval.total_units END, 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN totalval
  ON p.product_id = totalval.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;
