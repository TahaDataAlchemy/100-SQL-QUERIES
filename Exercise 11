Consider two tables named orders and customers.

The orders table contains columns:

order_id,

customer_id,

order_date, and

total_amount.

The customers table contains columns:

customer_id,

name, and

country.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the total amount of orders placed by customers from each country.


SOLUTION 

SELECT SUM(o.total_amount) as total_order_amount,c.country
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country
