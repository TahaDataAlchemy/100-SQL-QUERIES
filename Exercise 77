A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS salaryRank
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
)

SELECT Department, Employee, salary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE salaryRank <= 3;
