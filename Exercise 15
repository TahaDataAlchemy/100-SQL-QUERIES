Suppose you have two tables named

employees with columns: employee_id, name, department_id, and salary.

departments with columns: department_id and department_name.

Write an SQL query to find the department with the highest average salary.


SOLUTIONS

SELECT department_name
FROM (
    SELECT 
        d.department_name,
        AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
    FROM 
        employees e
    JOIN 
        departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    GROUP BY 
        d.department_name
    ORDER BY 
        average_salary DESC
    LIMIT 1
) AS top_department;
