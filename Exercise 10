Imagine you have two tables named

employees with columns: employee_id, name, department_id, and salary.

departments with columns: department_id and department_name.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the average salary for each department.

SOLUTION 

SELECT d.department_id as department_id, 
    d.department_name as department_name, 
    AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
FROM 
    employees e
JOIN 
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY 
    d.department_name
ORDER BY department_id
