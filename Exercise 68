Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

SELECT DISTINCT product_id,
       CASE 
           WHEN product_id IN (
               SELECT product_id
               FROM Products
               GROUP BY product_id
               HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN change_date <= '2019-08-16' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
               AND SUM(CASE WHEN change_date > '2019-08-16' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
           ) THEN 10
           ELSE (
               SELECT new_price
               FROM Products p2
               WHERE p1.product_id = p2.product_id
                 AND p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
               ORDER BY p2.change_date DESC
               LIMIT 1
           )
       END AS price
FROM Products p1;
