Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 


With cte as (SELECT v.visit_id,v.customer_id,t.amount,t.transaction_id 
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
on v.visit_id = t.visit_id)


SELECT customer_id, COUNT(customer_id) as count_no_trans 
FROM cte 
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY count_no_trans  DESC
