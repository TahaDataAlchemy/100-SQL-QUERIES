Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.


WITH totalUsers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS TotalUse
    FROM Users
)
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) / totalUsers.TotalUse) * 100,2) AS percentage
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Register r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
JOIN totalUsers 
WHERE r.contest_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC , r.contest_id ASC
