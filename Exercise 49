Find the top 5 states with the most 5 star businesses. Output the state name along with the number of 5-star businesses and order records by the number of 5-star businesses in descending order. In case there are ties in the number of businesses, return all the unique states. If two states have the same result, sort them in alphabetical order.


WITH yelp_5star AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM yelp_business
    WHERE stars = 5
),

Top5th AS (
    SELECT state, COUNT(stars) AS TopStarRes
    FROM yelp_5star 
    GROUP BY state
    ORDER BY TopStarRes DESC, state ASC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4
)

SELECT state, COUNT(stars) AS TopStarRes
FROM yelp_5star
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(stars) >= (SELECT TopStarRes FROM Top5th)
ORDER BY TopStarRes DESC, state ASC;
