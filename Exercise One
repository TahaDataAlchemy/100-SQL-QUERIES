You are given a database table named paperwork which contains two columns: n and m. Each row in the table represents a pair of integers. You need to write an SQL query to select the following:

The value of n.

The value of m.

A calculated result, res, which is defined as follows:

If either n or m is negative, res should be 0.

Otherwise, res should be the product of n and m.

The goal is to produce a result set where each row contains the values of n, m, and the computed res based on the specified conditions.

**SOLUTION**

SELECT pw.n,pw.m,
    CASE 
        when pw.n<0 OR pw.m<0 THEN 0
        ELSE pw.n*pw.m
    END AS res
FROM paperwork as pw
