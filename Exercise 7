Let's consider a table named orders with columns: order_id, customer_id, order_date, and total_amount. Write an SQL query to retrieve the total amount of orders placed in the month of June 2023.

SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount_june_2023
FROM orders
WHERE strftime('%Y',order_date) = '2023' and strftime('%m',order_date) = '06'
