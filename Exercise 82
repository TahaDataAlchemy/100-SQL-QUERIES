Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

# Write your MySQL query statement below
With DistinctSalary as (
    SELECT DISTINCT(salary) as disSal
    FROM Employee
    
),
RANKEDSAL AS (
    SELECT disSal as SecondHighestSalary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY disSal DESC) as SalaryRank
    FROM DistinctSalary
)

SELECT COALESCE(
           (SELECT SecondHighestSalary
            FROM RANKEDSAL
            WHERE SalaryRank = 2), NULL
       ) AS SecondHighestSalary;
