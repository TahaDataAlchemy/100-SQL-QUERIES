Consider two tables named

students with columns: student_id, name, and age.

courses with columns: course_id, course_name, and student_id indicating which student is enrolled in which course.

Write an SQL query to find the number of courses each student is enrolled in

SOLUTION 

select s.student_id,s.name ,COUNT(c.course_id) as enrolled_courses
from students s
join courses  c
on s.student_id = c.student_id
group by s.name
order by enrolled_courses DESC
