Consider two tables:

students with columns: student_id, name, and age.

grades with columns: student_id, course, and grade.

Write an SQL query to find the average grade for each student.


SOLUTION

select s.student_id,s.name,AVG(g.grade) as average_grade
from students s
JOIN grades g
ON s.student_id = g.student_id
group by s.student_id,s.name
