Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.


SELECT  a.user_id
FROM amazon_transactions a
JOIN amazon_transactions b 
    ON a.user_id = b.user_id 
    AND a.id < b.id  
WHERE DATEDIFF(a.created_at, b.created_at) BETWEEN 1 AND 7
