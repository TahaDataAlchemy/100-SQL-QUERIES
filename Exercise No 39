For those customers from the existing list who put one or more orders, or which orders have been placed by the customer who is not on the list, create a report containing the customer name, city, order number, order date, and purchase amount


SELECT 
    c.cust_name, 
    c.city, 
    o.ord_no, 
    o.ord_date, 
    o.purch_amt
FROM 
    customer c
JOIN 
    orders o 
ON 
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.ord_no IS NOT NULL OR  c.customer_id IS NULL
