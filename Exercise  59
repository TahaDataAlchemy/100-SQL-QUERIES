If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.


WITH first_order as (
    SELECT customer_id ,MIN(order_date) as first_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id 
),
Processed as (SELECT f.customer_id, SUM(
    CASE WHEN f.first_date!=d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
) AS sch,
SUM(CASE WHEN f.first_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS imd,
COUNT(*) AS TOTAL
FROM Delivery d
JOIN first_order f
ON d.customer_id = f.customer_id AND f.first_date = d.order_date)

select ROUND((imd/TOTAL)*100,2) as immediate_percentage 
FROM Processed
