You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

WITH virtualcustomer
     AS (SELECT visited_on,
                SUM(amount) AS vc_amount
         FROM   customer
         GROUP  BY visited_on)
SELECT visited_on,
       amount,
       average_amount
FROM   (SELECT visited_on,
               SUM(vc_amount) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount,
               Round(Avg(vc_amount) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 preceding AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS average_amount,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY visited_on) AS rn
        FROM   virtualcustomer) AS t
WHERE  rn > 6
ORDER  BY visited_on;
