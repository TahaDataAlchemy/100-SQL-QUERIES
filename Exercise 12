employees with columns: employee_id, name, department_id, and salary.

departments with columns: department_id and department_name.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the department names along with the total number of employees in each department.

select d.department_name ,COUNT(e.name) as total_employees
from employees e
join departments d
on e.department_id = d.department_id
group by d.department_name
