Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.


WITH CTE AS (
    -- Assign row numbers to each student in order of their id
    SELECT id, student, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS rn
    FROM Seat
)

SELECT CASE
            WHEN rn%2=1 AND rn+1<=(SELECT MAX(rn) from CTE) THEN id+1
            WHEN rn%2=0 THEN id-1
            ELSE id
        END as id,student
from CTE
order by id
