Write a SQL statement to join the tables salesman, customer and orders so that the same column of each table appears once and only the relational rows are returned.

SELECT
    o.ord_no,
    o.purch_amt,
    o.ord_date,
    c.customer_id,
    c.cust_name,
    c.city AS customer_city,
    c.grade,
    s.salesman_id,
    s.name AS salesman_name,
    s.city AS salesman_city,
    s.commission
FROM
    orders o
JOIN
    customer c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN
    salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id;
